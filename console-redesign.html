			<p> March 2020 - Soft launch in August 2021</p>

			<h1> Introduction </h1>
			<h4> Summary </h4>
			<p> This project redesigned the Fireblocks web app to tailor fit the business operations of our customers, increase usability, and better reflect product values. </p>

		<!-- 	<h4>What is Fireblocks?</h4>
			<p>Fireblocks was born out of a simple need for our customers to custody their digital assets (i.e. crypto coins) in a secure way. If you don’t know much about crypto, whoever holds the key - a string of letters and numbers - to your crypto, owns the coin. Fireblock’s technology provides a solution for customers to hold on to their keys, and their customers’ keys, in a safe way. This technology allows crypto businesses to scale in a way that wasn’t possible before, as they can suddenly safely custody many digital assets.</p> -->

		<div class="text-main">
				<h1>Opportunity</h1>
				<p>At the time we started the redesign project we had 25 customers who were mostly OTC (Over the Counter Trading Firms) and Hedge Funds who needed a secure solution for safeguarding their digital assets. We saw an opportunity to take the platform beyond security.</p>
				<!-- Beyond security, we redesigned the app to better support our customers’ daily operations & management of digital assets. -->
				<h2 class="caption-text"> Transform the web app from a security tool to a <b>platform</b> that <b>supports more business operations</b> and <b>user flows</b> of our customers. </h2>

				<h4>Business Goals</h4>
				<ul>
					<li><p>Increase usability on the product, our revenue is directly related to usage amount </p></li>
					<li><p>Increase pricing</p></li>
					<li><p>Drive the network perception - Fireblocks is a network solution</p></li>

				<p>I worked with the product manager and our design partners to collect both <b>qualitative and quantitive research primarily through user interviews</b> to better understand our customers' business operations.

					<h1> Clear reflection of how much you have and where</h1>
					<p> First, we changed the information architecture, grouping together all the accounts and assets that belonged to the company, and separating them from external counterparties, addresses, or accounts that they traded with. </p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<img src="imgs/FIREBLOCKS/information-architecture.svg"/>
			<div class="text-main">
				<h2> Two views for company funds </h2>
				<p> Second, we gave the user two ways to view their funds: by asset type, and by account type.</p>
			</div>
			<img src="imgs/fireblocks/myfunds-view-img.svg"/>
			<div class="text-main">
				<h2>Design considerations: Asset View</h2>

				<h4>Breakdown company funds by assets</h4>
				<p>Maybe juxtapose the totals for the highest valued assets side by side, or show a graph breakdown.</p>

				<h4>Distribution of an asset amoungs accounts</h4>
				<p>See the total amount the company holds of a specific asset and how it is distributed throughout their accounts. </p>


				<h4>Number of assets to show</h4>
				<p>On average, the number of assets being used on a daily bases was under 7, however total amount of assets that they held was in the 100s. Therefore, the design had to give quick access to the most commonly used assets while still allowing easy access to the rest. </p>


				<h3>Layout option 1 - master -> detail </h3>
				<p>This option creates a horizontal hierarchy, with the the selected item on the left, and the details on the right.</p>

				<h5>Pros:</h5>
				<ul>
					<li><p>Scrolling vertically through a list of assets is quick and easy for users. Also search, sort, and filters for visual columns is more familiar than it is in horizontal carousels. </p></li>
				</ul>
				<h5>Cons:</h5>
				<ul>
					<li><p>There is less space for extra columns in the table rows on the right. </p></li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<img class="close" src="imgs/fireblocks/asset-view-option1.svg"/>
			
			<div class="text-main">
				<h3>Layout option 2 - carousel</h3>
				<p>This option supports a vertical hierarchy, with the the selected item on the top, and the details underneath.</p>

				<h5>Pros:</h5>
					<ul>
						<li><p>The hierarchy being top down, breaks the vertical rhythm of the rest of the layout. </p></li>
						<li><p>More horizontal space for extra columns in the rows or new panels with extra information. </p></li>
					</ul>
				<h5>Cons:</h5>
					<ul>
						<li><p>Scroll, sort, and search are all less intuitive. Is it very obvious that the carousel controls the lower part of the page? </p></li>

				<p>Similarly to the assets view, the final design took the vertical hierarchy layout.

					<h1> Easier transfer flow</h1>
					<p> Although each of the main user flows serves a different task, they all involve making a transfer. Making sure the experience is efficient and easy is paramount to the success of the users tasks. To do this I focused on three aspects: <b>initiation, execution, and follow-up.</b></p>
				</div>

				<h2> Initiating a transfer </h2>
				<p>In order to answer this question I went back to the user flows and thought about the point that the user would go about transferring. In order to make a transfer, the user will always need the following information: <b>what asset, how much, and from where to where</b>.</p>

				<h3> A main call to action button</h3>
				<p>In some cases the user already has all this information ready for transfer. They may have just completed a different transfer, looked at their accounts for rebalancing, etc. Therefore, I created a very dominant main action button “Transfer”, that opens the transfer dialog blank.</p>

			</div>
			<img src="imgs/fireblocks/main-transfer-button-flow.svg"/>
			<div class="text-main">
				<h4>Micro-interaction on the button</h4>
				<p>The hover effect I designed intends to invite action and reflect the movement of assets that happens in a transfer. I executed this interaction, both in prototyping but also using codepen, and delivered the codepen to the developer to copy.</p>

			<div class="text-main">
				<h3> Many touchpoints on all venues </h3>
				<p>In other cases, the user may be working with the platform to view their funds, and think “I need to transfer from here”. For a seamless experience, I added touchpoints for initiating a transfer from each venue in the system - all accounts, all counterparties, all assets. In these cases, the user can start a transfer by clicking deposit/withdraw from any venue and the transfer dialog will be pre-filled with the relevant inputs.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="text-main">
				<h4> Hover on row accentuates call to action </h4>
				<p>In order to invite the user to start a transaction, hovering on any venue in the platform shows the transfer buttons, accentuating the possible action on the venue. Furthermore, when hovering on the button itself the icon lights-up and a tooltip appears with the action description.   </p>

				<h2> Executing a transfer </h2>
				<p> We wanted to create a feeling of confidence, ease, security, clarity, and efficiency when making a transfer. </p>

				<h4> Option 1 - full page wizard</h4>
				<p> One direction I explored and user tested was a transaction creation wizard.</p>
				<h5>Pros:</h5>
						<ul>
							<li><p>More space - transfers details sometimes get intricate with the ever changing landscape of crypto. It was nice to give the selection area lots of space leaving lots of room for flexibility between venues & blockchains. </p></li>
							<li><p>Walks the user through the selection/inputs in a friendly way </p></li>
						</ul>
				<h5>Cons:</h5>
					<ul>
						<li><p>Progress wizards are usually used for complex processes, therefore in a way making the transfer action seem a little too complex & involving many steps</p></li>
						<li><p>In user testing, some users felt like a wizard was for “beginners”, and they were “pros” who liked to work quickly</p></li>
					</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="full-page-img-container">
				<img src="imgs/fireblocks/create-transfer-wizard.svg"/>
			</div>
			<div class="text-main">
				<h4> Option 2 - dialog/form <h4>
				<p> The other direction I explored and user tested was a popup form/dialog. </p>
				<h5>Pros:</h5>
						<ul>
							<li><p>Many other crypto transfer interfaces use a form</p></li>
							<li><p>The fact that it is not a full page modal makes it seem more straightforward/fast</p></li>
						</ul>
				<h5>Cons:</h5>
					<ul>
						<li><p>Have to be more creative when it comes to adding complex fields as it all has to fit in the framework of a form</p></li>
						<li><p>If we need to add more inputs there will eventually be a scroll and then all the details of the transfer won’t show above the fold</p></li>

					<h3>Final transfer dialog</h3>
					<p>In our user tests, we asked the users to perform transactions  and observed how long it took them and if they got stuck or confused. Through a process of iterations, the final design took the following shape:</p>

				<div class="video-wrap-text">
					<div class="comments vertical">

					<h2> Follow up of a transfer</h2>
					<p>Following incoming and outgoing transactions is one of the crucial parts of all the user flows. When designing this panel, some of the main questions I was grappling with were: how many transactions to show at once, how much information to show at a glance, and how to show extra levels of information.</p>
					<p> Below are some of the designs we tested for comprehension on design partners. </p>

				<h1> Lessons and Reflections </h1>
				<ul>
					<li><p>Set concrete KPIs, even if you are a small company. It was very challenging collecting hard data around the successes of the project!</p>
					<li><p>Involve the PM & stakeholders from the very beginning. Buy in goes a long way. </p></li>
					<li><p>Keep UX separate from UI as much as possible especially if you don’t have a design system in place</p></li>
				</ul>

				<h2> Results </h2>
				<p>Fireblocks customers are still using this platform to this day.  After we launched the new platform we deprecated the old one, and although our existing users had a shocking transition as we didn’t build a robust onboarding experience, after a while we got great direct feedback from them and new customers about the experience on our platform, and that it was significantly better than our direct competitors.</p>
