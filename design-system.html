			<h1> Introduction </h1>
			<h4> Overview </h4>
			<p> As part of the Web-app Redesign Project, I developed a new visual language and design system for the web-app.</p>

			<h4>Team</h4>
			<p>Lead & only designer <br> 4 front end developers</p>

			<h4>Why did we want a new look?</h4>
			<p>The existing visual language of the product was heavy, alluding to all those anti-virus and hacking platforms that scream - be careful in this dark cyber world! Since the goal of redesigning the web-app was to transform it from a security focused tool to a platform for daily use, we wanted a new look that communicates: fintech, innovation, and a hub in which you start your day. </p>

			<h4> Why did we need a design system? </h4>
			<p>We needed a solid foundation that would make sure the design was unified in the product, set the ground for the team to grow in the future, and maintain design integrity and scalability across the platform. Design Systems were becoming common practice in leading companies around this time and we had to jump on the wagon.</p>

			<h4> Challenges & constraints </h4>
			<ul>
				<li><p>I was the only designer at the company, meaning I had my hands full and could not devote full-time to the design system.</p></li>
				<li><p>We had a very short timeline, as we needed to launch the new app as quickly as possible in order to kill competition. So the design system had to be created simultaneously with the design of the product (read about that process here).</p></li>
				<li><p>I migrated from Sketch to Figma in the middle of design, which meant rebuilding all components between designing - but it was worth it!</p></li>
			</ul>

				<h1>How we started - defining product values</h1>
				<p>I held an activity with the product team and other stakeholders in which we brainstormed what the Fireblocks product represents by individually jotting down words on post-its. After that, we put our post-its on the wall grouping them together with others that were similar. We then used dot voting to narrow down a list of our top words. Here was what we came up with:</p>
				<img src="imgs/fireblocks/product-values.svg"/>
				<p> Next, we did an exercise that further explored each of these values. I put all the words into a hat and each person picked one out. For each word, the participant had to come up with: one digital reference that embodied this word, one physical reference (non digital), and how they thought this value integrated with the product. This gave me some starting points to begin the visual exploration. </p>

				<h4>Concepts & references</h4>
				<p>Next I collected references and created a mood board of concepts. I looked at: our competitors, other tools our users might be using, and other products in the crypto industry and in fintech. 
				<br><br>
				From there I created a few conceptual UI stills that tested out some colors, typography, and component styles within the general layout I designed for the console. I showed these concept images to stakeholders and marketing, and after a few iterations I had a basic visual direction.

			<h1>Atoms to organisms</h1>
			<p>I was inspired by the Atomic Design System Methodology by Bob Frost. In fact it blew my mind. Genius! It helped me both in how to approach and structure the design system. </p>
			<img src='imgs/fireblocks/bob-frost.png'/>
			<img src="imgs/fireblocks/list-parts.svg"/>

			<h2> Atoms (fundamentals)</h2>
			

			<h3> Typography </h3>

			<h4> I chose two font pairs for the system </h4>
			<p>“Heebo”, a clean modern font that works well with numbers, this I intended to use for most of the system. I chose another font - Futura, to use sparingly in headlines in order to spice up the system and give it that contemporary look and feel that would communicate “fin-tech”, modern, cutting edge, serious but non-traditional. I also liked the symmetrical and round shapes of Futura, which paired well with the shape motif in the brand & logo. </p>

			<h4>Creating the type system</h4>
			<p>This took me a few iterations to get right. At first, I found it difficult to pre-define the styles without having designed any screens of the platform. Therefore, I began designing screens and created/added styles as I went. I quickly learned that this confused me. I had too much freedom and I ended up creating hierarchies and names that didn’t make sense. So instead I just chose many predefined type styles, and as I went along designing the platform I would tweak them to a better fit if needed, and after a while cut out the ones I didn’t ever use. As the platform design became more established, the type system started coming together. When the design team eventually grew from 1 to 8 team members, the system was received very well. Yay!

			<h3> Colors </h3>
			<h4> Choosing colors </h4>
			<p> The previous web app used dark blue gradients, and the marketing team was using orange and a dark grey color. We wanted to unify the platform and marketing site as well as tweek the colors to be more fresh and light for our new platform. Therefore, we agreed to tone down the orange in the brand, as it is a color that is associated with creativity, joy, play, and threats/warnings. Additionally, we brightened up the primary blue color, giving off a feeling that is more tech and less crypto. I also established some standard gray colors and primary variants that were shared with marketing. </p>

			<h4> Creating the color system </h4>
			<p> Creating a color system was not an easy task, and today I would do it differently.  I gave every color a number: such as “Primary 1”, “Primary 2”, and “Shade 1”, “Shade 2”. This worked well, however to take it a step further, today I would tokenize these shades and link them to their usages: “Background - light”, “Background - dark” and so on. Figma and the rest of the design community have really paved the way by creating much more established methodologies and tools for systemizing colors in the design system.</p>

			<h2> Spacing </h2>
			<h4> Basic spacers </h4>
			<p>When it came to spacing, at first I chose “4” as the base number, influenced by a Medium article I read called <a href="https://medium.com/@aratidube12lns/4-point-grid-system-for-more-consistent-interface-design-efea81dea3f3" class="link">the 4-Point Grid System for More Consistent Interface Design </a>. However as I progressed I decided to simplify even more to a spacing system of “8”  which created less variants than one of “4”. This spacing system made it very easy to determine spacing between and within elements, such as padding and height of components. It also made it easy to communicate with developers about spacing and creating consistency as well as communicating with developers.</p>
			<img src="imgs/fireblocks/space-image.png"/>
			<h4> Grid </h4>
			<p> For the grid I used 12 columns and gutters of 24, influenced by lots of schools of thoughts on the web, including Material Design. 12 gives you a nice set of areas to play with, and is also easily divisible into half, quarters, three quarters, etc. I used 24pts as Gutters because of the spacer “8” I chose. The margins were 32px on smaller resolutions, and on larger resolutions 48px, and the columns themselves were responsive in their width. </p>
			<img src="imgs/fireblocks/grid-img.png"/>
			<h2> Icons & illustrations </h2>
			<h3> Shape motif </h3>
			<p> The Fireblocks logo - a square with a triangle inside - inspired a shape motif for both the icons and the illustrations style. Together with the marketing team, I established a different meaning for each shape in both the brand and the platform: </p>
			<h4> The triangle </h4>
			<ul>
				<li><p> Fire - representing the transformative, fast, and cutting edge nature of Fireblocks. </p> </li>
				<li><p> An arrow - representing the movement and transfer of money. </p></li>
				<li><p> A delta - representing change and innovation. </p> </li>
			</ul>

			<h4> The square </h4>
			<ul>
				<li><p> A “block” in the blockchain.  </p> </li>
				<li><p> A source or destination, where money moves in or out of. </p></li>
			</ul>

			<h4> The circle</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><p> A digital asset: alluding to the shape of physical coins. </p> </li>
			</ul>
			<h3> Filled rather than stroked </h3>
			<p> Again set by the Fireblocks logo which uses solid shapes, the icons and illustrations followed suit. In addition I chose a dual-tone style for the icons creating a subdued effect that is simple but also a little more sophisticated than a monotone style./p>
